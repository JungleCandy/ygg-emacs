;; `(online?)` is a function that tries to detect whether you are online.
;; We want to refresh our package list on Emacs start if we are.

;; Emacs comes with a package manager for installing more features.
;; The default package repository doesn't contain much, so we tell it
;; to use MELPA as well.
(setq package-user-dir (concat user-emacs-directory "elpa"))

(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)

;; To get the package manager going, we invoke its initialise function.
(package-initialize)

;; If we're online, we attempt to fetch the package directories if
;; we don't have a local copy already. This lets us start installing
;; packages right away from a clean install.

;; `Paradox' is an enhanced interface for package management, which also
;; provides some helpful utility functions we're going to be using
;; extensively. Thus, the first thing we do is install it if it's not there
;; already.

;; We're going to be using `use-package' to manage our dependencies.
;; In its simplest form, we can call eg. `(use-package lolcode-mode)'
;; to install the `lolcode-mode' package. We'd also declare one or more
;; entry points so the module isn't loaded unneccesarily at startup.
;; For instance, `(use-package my-module :commands (my-function))' will
;; defer loading `my-module' until you actually call `(my-function)'.
;;
;; Read about it in detail at https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package

;; First, we make sure it's installed, using a function provided by
;; Paradox, which we've just installed the hard way.
(paradox-require 'use-package)

;; Next, we load it so it's always available.
